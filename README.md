Hi! If you're reading this, you are viewing a professional profile that was created using Gatsby.js.

Gatsby is a static site generator that uses React.

Here is my web app hosted by Google Cloud Platform:

https://johnbdev.web.app

This site uses several Gatsby plugins using lazy-loading images. This speeds up loading the page.

The images on my blog are personally taken by me in <b>Emeryville and Seoul.</b> 

The pages load quickly, with the pictures being served secondarily.

I am using the Gatsby Theme [`@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog`] by LekoArts.

Here are some of the features:

- MDX for easy HTML input
- Light Mode / Dark Mode
- Minimal style with hover for projects.
