This is my Gatsby project that uses several Gatsby plugins using lazy-loading images. Gatsby is a static site generator in which pages are partially rendered server and uses Javascript React to run sites quickly and optimized for SEO. 

The backend is Firebase running on Google Cloud. 

The images on my blog are personally taken by me in <b>Emeryville, Seoul, and Newport Beach.</b> 

I am using the Gatsby Theme [`@lekoarts/gatsby-theme-minimal-blog`] by LekoArts.

Features:

- MDX
- Light Mode / Dark Mode
- Typography driven, minimal style
